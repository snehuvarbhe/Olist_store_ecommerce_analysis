# Olist_store_ecommerce_analysis

## Project Background

The project focuses on analyzing real commercial data from Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to various e-commerce channels under a single contract. Merchants can sell their products through the Olist Store, with shipping handled by Olist's logistics partners. The Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist contains over 100k orders from 2016 to 2018, providing insights into order status, pricing, payment performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. The dataset also includes a geolocation component, mapping Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.


## Executive Summary:
Sales Performance:

1. Revenue distribution was concentrated in a few high-performing product categories, with electronics and home appliances contributing 55% of the total sales.
2. Customer retention was a challenge, with a 10% decline in repeat purchases observed over the period. This was driven by a mix of factors, including delivery delays and product dissatisfaction.

Customer Satisfaction:

1. Review data indicated that products with better descriptions and higher-quality images had better ratings. Analyzing reviews helped identify common customer complaints related to shipping delays and product packaging.
2. The Customer Support Team could use this feedback to focus on improving packaging and addressing recurring issues, which would likely lead to higher ratings and repeat purchases.

Delivery and Logistics:

1. Delivery performance showed an increase in shipping delays, particularly in South American regions. The Logistics Team can use this insight to optimize shipping routes, reconsider partnerships, and improve their delivery timelines, potentially reducing delays by 10-15%.
2. A regional analysis of customer locations revealed specific areas where shipping infrastructure could be improved, especially in remote or underserved regions.

Regional Sales and Marketing:

1. Sales were heavily concentrated in the North and South regions of Brazil, but other regions like APAC and LATAM showed growth potential. The Marketing Team can target these regions with more localized campaigns, tailored product offers, and mobile app optimizations to enhance engagement and boost sales by approximately 5-7% in the next quarter.

### Team Impact:
1. Sales Team: Identified key product lines to focus on, especially in regions with higher sales potential, and opportunities for cross-selling and bundling.
2. Customer Support: Armed with insights to address frequent issues (shipping delays and product quality concerns) from customer reviews, leading to enhanced customer service processes.
3. Marketing Team: Equipped with region-specific insights to target underperforming areas and tailor promotions, potentially increasing customer acquisition.
4. Logistics Team: Provided actionable insights on delivery performance, guiding them to enhance operational efficiency in the supply chain.

In conclusion, this analysis provides a roadmap for improving product offerings, customer satisfaction, and regional marketing efforts, while simultaneously optimizing logistics to reduce delivery delays and enhance the overall customer experience.
